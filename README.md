# Northcoders News API

## Background

We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

Your database will be PSQL, and you will interact with it using [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/).

## Cloning and Running Project Locally

You will need to create the .env.test and .env.development files after cloning the project and add the PGDATABASE = database_name to the files to be able to run it locally.

The minimum version of [Node.js] required is: v18.4.0 and the minimum version of [Postgres] required is : 14.3
